# Shoulders of giants

You may have noticed the pace of change in the world, especially in technology, is accelerating.

It is almost impossible, at any given time, to pinpoint what is the best technology for any given application. Even asking the question leads to other questions.

- Full stack monolith or microservices?
- Framework - no framework?
- Javascript, Typescript, Noscript?

As a technology consultant, I've had to come up my own set of rules to allow to me to make since of the technology landscape. To do this, my number one tool is **looking over the shoulders of giants**.

## The Giants

Here are some of the developers I like to follow

- [David Heinemeier Hansson](https://dhh.dk) - the developer of Rails
  - For me Rails was a revelation. Even today, when I get a chance to work in the framework, it feels like I'm slipping into a well used glove. Everything is in the right place. The development friction encountered in other tools is gone. David just gets the developer experience. In a framework, that is where the value is.
- [Yehuda Katz](https://yehudakatz.com) - Ember, Bundler [more](https://yehudakatz.com/projects/) ...
  - Core contributer to Rails, especially in the (bumpy) transition from Rails 2 to 3. Yehuda is practically omnipresent in the technology landscape.
- [Jeremy Ashkenas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeremy_Ashkenas) - Coffeescript
  - There is something about a person/developer that says to himself one day, "you know this javascript is ok, but I can make it better by writing my own transpiler."
  - Given the rise of Typescript, I've kind of moved on from Coffeescript but I think Jeremy has something insanely great up his sleeve.
- [Jose Valim](https://github.com/josevalim) For awhile, a core (and vital IMO) contributer to Rails now developing Elixir
  - Jose is just one of the guys who I simply can not grasp the breadth of their knowledge
