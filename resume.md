## Why me?

My best asset is my **interest**. I keep up with web development trends (both front and back) because I love it.

- I seek **value** - how is this technology going to help me create value for myself and others?
- **Finding** the right tool for the job used to be the hardest part. Now, **choosing**, the right tool is hardest.
- I've got 20 years of experience choosing and implementing the right tools for the job.
